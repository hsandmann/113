### Challenge

This project will decode voices to text and will try to decode the text. This one will use same Natural Language Processing (NLP) Approaches.

**Deadline:** Nov. 3rd, 2019.

### Strategy



Sound -> Vocabulos -> Text -> Normalization -> Context -> Classification

Repository

### Preconditions

 - Microphone array -> almost ambient free noise

### State-of-art

### Requests

We would like to propose you a challenge. The challenge is the following:

1. You should analyze the state of the art regarding audio classification using a microphone array. With this we expect:

2. You should propose a high level solution to at least the following approaches:

    a. Speech to text conversion into text classification
    
        i. State of the Art Speech to text Architectures
        ii. State of the Art Text Classification Architecture

    b. Audio features classification (End to End classification)
    
        i. What type of architectures are being used ? What’s the most promising ?
        ii. What type of Audio features would be interesting (exp. Frequency Domain Classification)
